(by #2 #4) Step 2: Calculate the number of days between the last day of Jan 2012 and today.\nWe know that the last day of Jan 2012 is 01/31/2012. To determine today's date, we need to know how many days have passed since 01/31/2012. Assuming that we are not in a leap year, February would have 28 days. As such, we add 28 days to 01/31/2012 to get 02/28/2012. Since today is some day between 02/01/2012 and 02/28/2012, we need to subtract the number of days that have passed in February so far. Since today is not a leap year, there have been 28 days in February. Thus, we subtract 28 days from 02/28/2012 to get 02/01/2012.\n\n#6.

Therefore, January 1, 2018 is a Monday.\n\n#6. (by #2) Step 2: Determine the number of days between the first Monday of 2019 and January 1, 2019.\nSince January 1, 2019 is a Tuesday, there are 6 days between January 1, 2019 and the first Monday of 2019 (January 7, 2019).\n\n#7.
