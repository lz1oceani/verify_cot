        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nMary found 2 seashells and Keith found 5 seashells on the beach . When they cleaned them , they discovered that 9 were cracked . How many seashells did they find together ?\nAnswer:\n",

(by #5 #8) The original question is #5. How many seashells did they find together? However, the result is negative, which does not make sense. Therefore, we need to check our calculations and find an error. We realize that in step 8, we made a mistake by subtracting the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found together. It should be the other way around. So we correct the calculation:\n\n#10. (by #4) Step 3 (corrected): Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells they found together.\nNumber of cracked seashells: 9\nNumber of seashells they found together: 7 + 9 = 16\n\n#11. (by #5 #10) The original question is #5. How many seashells did they find together? Now that we have corrected our mistake, the answer is that Mary and Keith found 16 seashells together.",

The problem does not ask for the total number of fruits Alice has, so there's no need to include the calculation about the bananas and oranges.\nResult: The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n\nReasoning Mistakes: The mistake lies in calculating the price per apple after discount. The correct calculation should be: price per apple after discount = $2 * (1 - 50%) = $1. Then, Alice's total cost of 5 apples would be: $1 * 5 = $5.\nResult: The reasoning process contains mistakes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n2. The reasoning process is wrong.\nResult: Based on the check, the answer is \"no\", the reasoning check fails.\n\nHere is some information:\n\"They found a total of x seashells.\nSubtract the number of cracked seashells from the total seashells found.\nNumber of seashells not cracked: 100 - 31 = 69\"\n\nBased on the given information, here is a reasoning process:\n\"The original question is #4.

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nMary had 21 dimes and 38 pennies in her bank .

(by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nJoan bought toy cars for $ 14.88 , a skateboard for $ 4.88 , and got toy trucks for $ 5.86 .

The problem does not ask for the total number of fruits Alice has, so there's no need to include the calculation about the bananas and oranges.\nResult: The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n\nReasoning Mistakes: The mistake lies in calculating the price per apple after discount. The correct calculation should be: price per apple after discount = $2 * (1 - 50%) = $1. Then, Alice's total cost of 5 apples would be: $1 * 5 = $5.\nResult: The reasoning process contains mistakes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n2. The reasoning process is wrong.\nResult: Based on the check, the answer is \"no\", the reasoning check fails.\n\nHere is some information:\n\"Joan bought toy cars for $14.88, a skateboard for $4.88, and got toy trucks for $5.86.\nJoan spent $14.55 on pants.\nThe question asks for the total amount Joan spent on toys.\"\n\nBased on the given information, here is a reasoning process:\n\"To find the total amount Joan spent on toys, we need to add up the cost of the toy cars, skateboard, and toy trucks.\nTotal cost of toys: $14.88 + $4.88 + $5.86 = $25.62\"\n\nLet's review the reasoning process and check:\n1.

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nMike joined his school 's band .

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nA restaurant served 7 slices of pie during lunch and 5 during dinner today . It served 8 of them yesterday . How many slices of pie were served today ?\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nThere are 7 crayons in the drawer and 6 crayons on the desk .

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4.

(by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nJoan found 72 seashells and 12 starfishes on the beach .

            "First, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.\n#2. John turns around and spends 4 hours trying to get home.\n#3. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.\n#4. John drives at 30 mph for half an hour before being able to drive the remaining time at 80 mph.\n#5. How far is John from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#6. (by #1) Step 1: Calculate the distance John travels in the first 3 hours.\nSpeed: 60 mph\nTime: 3 hours\nDistance: 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles\n\n#7. (by #2 #3) Step 2: Calculate the remaining time John has to travel home after spending 2 hours in standstill traffic.\nTotal time: 4 hours\nTime spent in traffic: 2 hours\nRemaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours\n\n#8. (by #4) Step 3: Calculate the distance John travels at 30 mph for half an hour.\nSpeed: 30 mph\nTime: 0.5 hours\nDistance: 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles\n\n#9. (by #4) Step 4: Calculate the distance John travels at 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours.\nSpeed: 80 mph\nTime: 1.5 hours\nDistance: 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles\n\n#10. (by #6 #8 #9) Step 5: Calculate the total distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.\nDistance traveled in the first 3 hours: 180 miles\nDistance traveled at 30 mph: 15 miles\nDistance traveled at 80 mph: 120 miles\nTotal distance: 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles\n\n#11. (by #5 #10) The original question is #5. How far is John from home at the end of those 4 hours? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
