        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nTake the last letters of each words in \"Yan Eunice Joseph Hugh\" and concatenate them.\nAnswer:\n",

End with \"yes\" or \"no\" for whether the reasoning check passes.\n\nAnswer:\nHere is the review:\nPurpose: \"Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount\"\n\nIrrelevant Steps: The calculation of Alice's total number of fruits is irrelevant to the problem. The problem does not ask for the total number of fruits Alice has, so there's no need to include the calculation about the bananas and oranges.\nResult: The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n\nReasoning Mistakes: The mistake lies in calculating the price per apple after discount. The correct calculation should be: price per apple after discount = $2 * (1 - 50%) = $1. Then, Alice's total cost of 5 apples would be: $1 * 5 = $5.\nResult: The reasoning process contains mistakes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n2.

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nTake the last letters of each words in \"Chantal Ines Valeria Francesca\" and concatenate them.\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nTake the last letters of each words in \"Clarissa Shauna Alexis Branden\" and concatenate them.\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels.

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels.

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nTake the last letters of each words in \"Sterling Jenifer Patsy Denise\" and concatenate them.\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6.

(by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels.

The problem does not ask for the total number of fruits Alice has, so there's no need to include the calculation about the bananas and oranges.\nResult: The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n\nReasoning Mistakes: The mistake lies in calculating the price per apple after discount. The correct calculation should be: price per apple after discount = $2 * (1 - 50%) = $1. Then, Alice's total cost of 5 apples would be: $1 * 5 = $5.\nResult: The reasoning process contains mistakes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. The reasoning process contains irrelevant steps.\n2.
