        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nMary found 2 seashells and Keith found 5 seashells on the beach . When they cleaned them , they discovered that 9 were cracked . How many seashells did they find together ?\nAnswer:\n",

(by #5 #8) The original question is #5. How many seashells did they find together? However, the result is negative, which does not make sense. Therefore, we need to check our calculations and find an error. We realize that in step 8, we made a mistake by subtracting the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found together. It should be the other way around. So we correct the calculation:\n\n#10. (by #4) Step 3 (corrected): Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells they found together.\nNumber of cracked seashells: 9\nNumber of seashells they found together: 7 + 9 = 16\n\n#11. (by #5 #10) The original question is #5. How many seashells did they find together? Now that we have corrected our mistake, the answer is that Mary and Keith found 16 seashells together.",

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nMary had 21 dimes and 38 pennies in her bank . Her dad borrowed 18 pennies from Mary . How many pennies does she have now ?\nAnswer:\n",

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nThere were 32 bales of hay in the barn and 26 bales in the shed . Jason stacked bales in the barn today . There are now 98 bales of hay in the barn . How many bales did he store in the barn ?\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nJoan bought toy cars for $ 14.88 , a skateboard for $ 4.88 , and got toy trucks for $ 5.86 .

        "model_input": "Question:\nAlice buys 5 apples. Each apple costs her $2. She gets them for 50% off. After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9.

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nA restaurant served 7 slices of pie during lunch and 5 during dinner today . It served 8 of them yesterday . How many slices of pie were served today ?\nAnswer:\n",

After she bought She decides she doesn't like 2 of them and sells them to her friends for 1. How much money was she out? \n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1. Alice gets 5 apples.\n#2. Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nThere are 7 crayons in the drawer and 6 crayons on the desk .

Each apple costs $2, but Alice gets apples for 50% off.\n#3. Alice sells 2 of 5 apples for 1.\n#4. How much money was Alice out?\n\nNext, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n\n#5. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate the price per apple after a 50% discount.\nOriginal price per apple: $2\nDiscount: 50%\nPrice per apple after discount: $2 * (1 - 0.50) = $2 * 0.50 = $1\n\n#6. (by#1 #5) Step 2: Calculate Alice's cost of the 5 apples after a 50% discount.\nPrice per apple after discount: $1\nTotal apples: 5\nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $1 * 5 = $5\n\n#7. (by #3) Step 3: Calculate the money Alice gets back from selling 2 apples. \nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\n\n#8. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Alice is out. \nAlice's total cost of 5 apples: $5\nMoney that Alice gets back from selling 2 apples: $1\nMoney that Alice is out: $5 - $1 = $4\n\n#9. (by #4 #8) The original question is #4. How much money was Alice out? We do not miss information on the rewritten labels. So the answer to this question is Alice is out $4.\n\nPlease answer the following question by following the above template. \n\nQuestion:\nKeith spent $ 136.01 on speakers , $ 139.38 on a CD player , and $ 112.46 on new tires .
